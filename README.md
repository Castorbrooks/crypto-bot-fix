# Crypto Bot Fix — Fast & Reliable

If your crypto trading bot is broken, crashing, or stopped after an exchange update —
I fix it.

No hype. No strategy promises.
Just clean fixes that stop losses.

## What I Fix Most Often

• Exchange API errors (Binance, Bybit, OKX)
  - permission / nonce / 429 / timestamp issues

• Telegram trading & alert bots
  - messages not sending
  - freezes / disconnects

• TradingView alerts → bot execution
  - alert fires but trade doesn’t
  - payload / webhook issues

• Grid / DCA bots misbehaving
  - wrong orders
  - over-trading bugs

## How It Works

1. You send the error message or screenshot
2. I confirm if it’s fixable
3. You pay in USDT
4. I deliver the fix (same day in most cases)

• Text-only communication  
• No API keys  
• No logins
